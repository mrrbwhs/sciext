    <h1>HSC Course – Science Extension</h1>

    <section>
      <h2><a href="module1.html">Module 1: The Foundations of Scientific Thinking</a></h2>
      <p>
        Explore historic and cultural observations, the way scientific research has changed over time, and how ethical frameworks have influenced this process. They consider philosophical arguments in relation to the nature of science to deepen their understanding and refine their own views of and about science.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2><a href="module2.html">Module 2: The Scientific Research Proposal
</a></h2>
      <p>
        Learn to develop a question that enables scientific research by exploring peer-reviewed published literature for guidance. Students will be guided to undertake relevant scientific research and to develop a detailed plan that lays the foundations for the subsequent processes to be employed to address a developed hypothesis.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2><a href="module3.html">Module 3: The Data, Evidence and Decisions
</a></h2>
      <p>
        Develop knowledge, understanding and skills related to the analytical techniques for accessing, storing and analysing high-volume unstructured secondary-sourced publicly available data set(s). Students will be provided with the opportunity to consider limitations and construct plausible inferences while understanding degrees of uncertainty in the data. Students will explore the difference between the concepts of proving that something is true and measuring the probability of a certain result by understanding falsification and statistical levels of confidence.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2><a href="module4.html">Module 4: The Research Report
</a></h2>
      <p>
        Assists students in making final additions to the related Scientific Research Portfolio and to complete the related Scientific Research Report.
      </p>
